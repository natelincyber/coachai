Coach: Hi Alex, it’s good to see you again. How have things been since our last session?

Client: Honestly, I’ve been feeling really anxious. My performance review is in two weeks, and it’s all I can think about.

Coach: I hear you. Performance reviews can bring up a lot of stress. What specifically is worrying you about it?

Client: I’m worried they’ll focus on the things I didn’t do well. Like, I know I missed a couple deadlines last quarter, and even though I caught up, I feel like those mistakes will outweigh everything else.

Coach: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. Are you finding that this anxiety is affecting you outside of work?

Client: Yeah, I’m losing sleep, and I keep replaying different conversations in my head—like, what my manager might say, how I’ll respond, whether I’ll cry or freeze up. I’ve even started avoiding talking to my team lead because I feel so unsure.

Coach: That sounds exhausting. You're under a lot of pressure, and your mind is trying to prepare you for every possible outcome. Let’s pause for a moment: have there been things you’re proud of this past year?

Client: I guess so. I led a team project that launched successfully, and we actually got really good feedback from the client. But I keep brushing that off because I feel like I should’ve done more.

Coach: That’s significant, Alex. You're minimizing your accomplishments and focusing only on potential negatives. That's a cognitive distortion called discounting the positive. It’s common, especially under stress.

Client: That makes sense. I just feel like I can’t afford to slip up.

Coach: So it’s not just about the review—it’s about proving your worth, maybe even feeling safe in your role?

Client: Yeah, exactly. I keep thinking, “What if they say I’m not good enough?” I tie my value to how that review goes.

Coach: That’s a powerful insight. Let’s talk about how to shift your mindset and build some tools to manage this stress over the next couple of weeks.

Client: That would be helpful. Right now I just feel stuck in this loop.

Coach: Let’s start with a simple grounding technique for moments when anxiety spikes. One is the 5-4-3-2-1 method—naming 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, and so on. It brings you back to the present.

Client: I’ve heard of that. I haven’t tried it much though.

Coach: We’ll add that to your daily check-ins. Also, I want you to journal every evening for the next week: one work accomplishment, one moment of resilience, and one thing you’re grateful for. It’ll help retrain your brain to notice what’s going right.

Client: That sounds doable. I think it would help to see it written down.

Coach: We’ll also practice reframing negative self-talk. For example, “What if they say I’m not good enough?” becomes “I’ve consistently contributed and grown—my review is a checkpoint, not a judgment.”

Client: I like that. It feels less final.

Coach: Great. Lastly, would you be open to writing a short self-evaluation draft before the review?

Client: Yeah, that actually sounds useful. I can focus on the progress I’ve made.

Coach: Perfect. Let’s work together to build a plan around these practices. We’ll use each day to reinforce the skills you need to feel more grounded, confident, and self-assured heading into that performance review.

Client: Thank you. This makes it feel more manageable.

Coach: You’re welcome. You’ve already taken a big step by showing up and naming your fear. Let’s keep building from there.
